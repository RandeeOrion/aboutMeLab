            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>
                    My name is Randee and what feels like a lifetime ago I graduated from the UW with a BA in Comparative History of Ideas (CHID) and Women Studies. A few years later I found myself working in corrections and needing a way out I completed the MBA program online through the University of Phoenix. After leaving corrections I worked in a few various jobs in the business development and marketing world. I was the Marketing Director for a small startup and left when my first child was born. Since then I have been a semi serial entrepreneur with my most successful and hardest to drop business being a guest house on wheels. I own a small trailer that I used to rent out as guest house, only not at my house. When folks came to visit YOU, you, or your guest, could rent my trailer. We would deliver it to your house, set it up, then when your guests left, take it away and clean it. I loved creating this business and was so sad when I finally admitted that I was not in a place in my life, and would not be for for many years, where I could run my business in a way that felt good to me, I closed up shop. A couple of years and a couple of other small business plans set a side, I have found myself here, with a brand new machine, learning how to code when two months ago I walked into an Apple store and told the hipster in the sleek Apple shirt to tell me what computer to buy because I quite literally knew nothing about the words that were coming out of his mouth.

                While I have several nuanced and complex goals or reasons for comming to Code Fellows, they all boil down to:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Get a flexible job in an industry that isn't going away.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a livable Seattle wage.
                    </li>
                </ul>
