            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Randee and while I spent my whole rural childhood desperately waiting to leave for the city, and I spent my young adulthood as an urban dweller, as a proud middle aged woman, I am now dreaming of returning to my rural roots.

                Much to the dismay of my Bellevue raised husband, our front yard is a gloriously, unruly and muddy in-ground garden, complete with five equally unruly chickens: Rey, Commander Leia, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, and Rosabelle. We have volunteer tomatoes plants commandeering space in the very intentionally painted cut flower patch, sunflowers peeking out of the beans, weeds we pretend are ground cover and as you walk around do be careful to look out for the glorious chicken poop that feeds it all. 
            </p>

                Every year I dig up more sod, collect more free raspberry canes from the side of the road, sprinkle clover seeds in the grass that is left in the hopes the bees will be better fed, and attempt to add hedges of witches hazel and elderberry. When I am finished with the Code Fellows program I plan on building a bigger coop, brood some fluffy ducklings and fill out my flock to the full eight the city of Seattle allows. If the timing is right I also plan on adding two colonies of honey bees.

                My plan is to continue to grow our urban farm until may husband finds the situation so ridiculous that he relents and agrees to buy several acres on Vashon Island and move. At which point, I can finally invent in the dairy cow I have been dreaming of, a small herd of alpacas, goats and sheep, and a sheep dog, learn how to herd and compete in the Sheep Dog Classic on Vashon.

            <!-- <p> -->
                  <!-- What feels like a lifetime ago I graduated from the UW with a BA in Comparative History of Ideas (CHID) and Women Studies. A few years later I found myself working in corrections and needing a way out I completed the MBA program online through the University of Phoenix. After leaving corrections I worked in a few various jobs in the business development and marketing world. I was the Marketing Director for a small startup and left when my first child was born. Since then I have been a semi serial entrepreneur with my most successful and hardest to drop business being a guest house on wheels. I own a small trailer that I used to rent out as guest house, only not at my house. When folks came to visit YOU, you, or your guest, could rent my trailer. We would deliver it to your house, set it up, then when your guests left, take it away and clean it. I loved creating this business and was so sad when I finally admitted that I was not in a place in my life, and would not be for for many years, where I could run my business in a way that felt good to me, I closed up shop. A couple of years and a couple of other small business plans set a side, I have found myself here, with a brand new machine, learning how to code when two months ago I walked into an Apple store and told the hipster in the sleek Apple shirt to tell me what computer to buy because I quite literally knew nothing about the words that were coming out of his mouth.  -->

                        Move to Vashon and homestead.

                    <li>
                        Get a flexible job in an industry that isn't going away.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a livable Seattle wage.
                    </li>
