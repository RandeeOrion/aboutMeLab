            <h1>A Smidgen About Randee</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Randee and while I spent my whole rural childhood desperately waiting to leave and head for the city, and I spent my young adulthood as an urban dweller, as a middle aged woman, I am now dreaming of returning to my rural roots. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Much to the dismay of my Bellevue raised husband, our front yard is a gloriously, unruly and muddy in-ground garden, complete with five equally unruly chickens: Rey, Commander Leia, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, and Rosabelle. We have volunteer tomatoes plants commandeering space in the very intentionally planted cut flower patch, sunflowers peeking out of the beans, weeds we pretend are ground cover and as you walk around, do be careful to look out for the glorious chicken poop that feeds it all.

                Every year I dig up more sod, collect more free raspberry canes from the side of the road, sprinkle clover seeds in the grass that is still left in the hopes the bees will be better fed, and attempt to add hedges of witches hazel and elderberry. When I am finished with the Code Fellows program I plan on building a bigger coop, brood some fluffy ducklings, and fill out my flock to the full eight the city of Seattle allows. If the timing is right I also plan on adding two colonies of honey bees.

                My plan is to continue to grow our urban farm until may husband finds the situation so ridiculous that he relents and agrees to buy several acres on Vashon Island, build our dream house and move. At which point, I can finally invest in the dairy cow I have been dreaming of, a small herd of alpacas, goats, and sheep, and a sheep dog that will quickly become my best friend, learn how to herd and compete in the <a href="https://www.vashonsheepdogclassic.com/" target="_blank">Sheepdog Classic on Vashon Island</a>.

            <p>
                While I have several nuanced and complex goals or reasons for coming to Code Fellows, they all boil down to:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Move to Vashon and homestead.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get a flexible job in an industry that isn't going away.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a livable Seattle wage (but live on Vashon.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
